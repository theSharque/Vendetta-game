# Vendetta :crossed_swords:

This game was introduced twice on the Google Play Store, and both times it was banned. In the game, players are divided into teams and hunt each other. Bluetooth technology confirms the shots. Every 15 minutes, a hunter receives the approximate location of their target. Each player acts as both a hunter and a target simultaneously. When a player is eliminated, their target becomes the new target for their hunter. The last one standing wins.

The game successfully passed all real-world tests but never gained popularity.
